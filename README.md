# Impact-of-vaccination-on-covid19-spread-pattern-in-different-US-states

Here, I used Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for spotting anomalies, and Matrix Profile (MP) for various experiments, like Semantic Segmentation and Anomaly Detection.

My objective was to find the optimal points to divide the Confirmed cases and Vaccine data into three stages. For the second stage, I tested the Semantic Segmentation method. This yielded a suitable timeframe for precise analysis. To compare data before and after vaccination, I used Anomaly Detection through MP and SSA.

This is just a snippet of the entire code. The project is still in progress and has not been completed yet. Once it's finished, I will upload the entire code here.
